# Moberating 101

### Turning Engineers in to a super computer

Note: Welcome to the moberator training, as mentioned to some you are guinea pigs in this training and the first to receive it. Please if you have a question or suggestion write it on a post it so we can talk about it in the end of each section.



# Topics

- Katas<!-- .element: class="fragment roll-in" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Pain Management <!-- .element: class="fragment roll-in" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- What is a Moberator <!-- .element: class="fragment roll-in" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Planning a mob <!-- .element: class="fragment roll-in" data-fragment-index="4" -->



## What is a <!-- .element: class="dt" -->
# Moberator: <!-- .element: class="dt" -->

The facilitator of the mob. Responsible for facilitating an environment where brilliance can happen. <!-- .element: class="dd" -->

Note: Organizes location and topics. Looks out for the welfare of the participants, keeps time. Required for beginning the mobbing process but good to have all the time. This can be a rotating hat.



## SetUp the Room

A mobbing environment needs:

- A screen all participants can see.
- A shared development environment.
- Protect from distraction

Note: All participants need to be able to see and type. some people like to sit, some people like to stand. Chairs and standing area should be provided. An Isolated are is good so that the group can get rowdy.



## Dynamic Role Assignment As needed

- Would you feel comfortable with ____? <!-- .element: class="fragment roll-in" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Can we re order? <!-- .element: class="fragment roll-in" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note: Depending on how the group has started one may need to ask for people to do different things through out the a session. A Researcher may need to be created. An product owner may need to be assumed to make sure the work stays in scope. Ask CLICK.



## What is a <!-- .element: class="dt" -->
# Kata? <!-- .element: class="dt" -->

A set combination of positions and movements performed as an exercise<!-- .element: class="dd" -->
<small>https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kata</small>

Note: Athletes at every level warm up with the same practice drills. Running or passing. Getting warmed up. In mobbing we have have made this a to mean small practices that we do on a regular basis to make us smaller.



## Koans Katas

- Questions
- Mini Retros
- Switching for what seels like no reason.

Note: When doing koans we have a regular practice of asking questions. Switching randomly or doing mini retros, all to maintain learning. Any person in their second Koans knows that the test is going to provide teh answer. But we need to know why that answer is. Switching takes time, the more you switch the faster it gets and the less monet it costs.  Retros let the group control how they learn.



## Koans Example Kata
### Stop and Ask.

- What did the code just do?
- What was new?
- What was hard?
- What did we learn about the language?
- What did we learn about working as a group?



## Mobbing Kata

- Mini and End of session retros
- Questions
- Swapping from (standing|sitting)

Note: This is a little different from the Koans, the goal is to get things done. Our Katas are going to be more focused on keeping the group productive than creating a learning environment.



## Mobbing Kata Questions

- Are we in scope?
- Do we need to add remove a _researcher_?
- Does anyone have any questions about what we have done?
- Any experiments for the next few rounds?

Note: Any Questions about Katas?



# Looking for Pain

Note: As a moberator we are always making sure things are moving forward. But the development is not the only thing that will be accelerated.



## Is someone marginalized? 

Note: We must always be on the look out for that look of pain on someones face. Are they confused? are they feeling stupid? Are the being talked over? How do we redirect the group? to end this? 



# On Ignorance

> It is okay to not know something. You are not stupid or dumb, you are just ignorant. This just means that you dont know something. We can fix ignorance with education.



## Is the group hurting itself?

Note: We do continuos experiments. Early on a group will say "can we get rid of the single _navigator_?" It may be a bad idea but the group has to learn that. Let them go the wrong direction, but prompt for self direction.



## Remind people of the Cadence

## Intent → Technical → Dictation



# Planning a mob

It is your job to sort out the:

- Room
- scope
- Programming environment

Note: this means finding a space in advance and setting it up right.



# Experiment! 




## Postits
 - keep a record of what people have learned, in real time.



## Order Switching

- Order By Height
- By Name Alpha
- Pair people you want to see work together

Note: It can be really helpful to pair sr and jr people together.

Note: Switch up the order
