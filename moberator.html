# Topics

- Katas<!-- .element: class="fragment roll-in" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Looking for Pain <!-- .element: class="fragment roll-in" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- What is a Moberator <!-- .element: class="fragment roll-in" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Planning a mob <!-- .element: class="fragment roll-in" data-fragment-index="4" -->



## What is a <!-- .element: class="dt" -->
# Moberator: <!-- .element: class="dt" -->

The facilitator of the mob. Responsibple for facilitating an enviroment where brillance can happen. <!-- .element: class="dd" -->

Note: Organizes location and topics. Looks out for the welfare of the participants, keeps time. Required for beginning the mobbing process but good to have all the time. This can be a rotating hat.



## SetUp the Room

A mobbing enviroment needs:

- A screen all participants can see.
- A sharrred development enviroment.

Note: All participants need to be able to see and type. some people like to sit, some people like to stand. Chairs and standang area should be provided. An Isolated are is good so that the group can get roudy.



## Dynamic Role Assignment As needed

- Would you feel comfortable with ____? <!-- .element: class="fragment roll-in" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Can we re order? <!-- .element: class="fragment roll-in" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note: Depending on how the group has started one may need to ask for people to do differnt things through out the asession. A Researcher may need to be created. An product owner may need to be assumed to make sure the work stays in scope. Ask CLICK.



## What is a <!-- .element: class="dt" -->
# Kata? <!-- .element: class="dt" -->

A set combination of positions and movements performed as an exercise<!-- .element: class="dd" -->
<small>https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kata</small>

Note: Athleets at every level warm up with the same practice drills. Running or passing. Getting warmed up. In mobbing we have have made this a to mean small practices that we do on a regualr basis to make us smaller.


## Koans Katas

- Questions
- Mini Retros
- Switching for what seels like no reason.

Note: When doing koans we have a regular practice of asking questions. Switching randomly or doing mini retors, all to maintain learning. Any person in their second Koans knows that the test is going to provide teh answer. But we need to know why that answer is. Switching takes time, the mroe you switch the faster it gets and the less monet it costs.  Retos let the group control how they learn.



## Koans Example Kata
### Ask.

- What did the code just do?
- What was new?
- What was hard?
- What did we learn about the language?
- What did we learn about working as a group?



# Looking for Pain
